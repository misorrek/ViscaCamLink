## Installation

### Windows installer

Execute the setup file (.msi) (e.g. by double-clicking or using the context menu) and follow the wizard. Then start the program (automatically if selected or manually via the Windows start menu) and continue with [First start](#first-start).

### Portable

Unpack the execution file (.exe) contained in the archive (.zip) to any location where the executing user has permissions. Then start it (e.g. by double-clicking or using the context menu) and proceed with [First start](#first-start).

## First start

Since .NET 6 is required for the application, a prompt will appear if this is not yet pre-installed. Simply follow this prompt and restart the application if necessary ([Manual installation - .NET Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)).

After that ViscaCamLink is ready for use.

## Usage 

After the first start, the IP address of the camera and the port for the VISCA protocol (if different from the default) must be typed in. (How to get this information is described in the user manual of the camera)

After that, the connection can be established using the corresponding button in the address bar. Whether this was successful is shown in the status display below. It also shows if the camera is switched on or is in standby mode.
